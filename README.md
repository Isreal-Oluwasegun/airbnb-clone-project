# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is my ALX project. It is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. 

It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. 
This project will enable me as a learner to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
